##Run the game
Simply, open the _index.html_ file in your favorite browser.

##How to play
The objective of the game is to reach the water, by crossing a field full of ugly **bugs**, hungry for your points!

Reach the water to be safe, and get points you had to run in the mug.</br>
**But** if a bug was faster and _caught_ you, you loose points and you have to start running all over again.

How can you avoid the bugs? By using the arrow keys.<br>
Press the:</br>
<kbd>up</kbd> arrow to move up, </br>
<kbd>down</kbd> arrow to move down, </br>
<kbd>left</kbd> arrow to move left, and</br>
<kbd>right</kbd> arrow to move right. </br>

<h5>Good Luck and have fun!</h5>
